You are assisting with a production codebase.

Rules:
- Do NOT introduce new frameworks or libraries unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT rewrite architecture.
- Make minimal, focused changes.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Ask for confirmation before refactoring more than one file.
- Do not assume this is a web app unless explicitly stated.
